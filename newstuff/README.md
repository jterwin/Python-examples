I will put some stuff here that is not read to publish yet...

Most codes need to be edited to be up to my current standard notation.

## IPython notebooks
These are like Mathematical sheets. You have many cells, some can
contain text (include LaTex), and other python computations and
matplotlib plots. They are a very nice way to organise some thoughts.

To look at the IPython notebook, you need to start a notebook server
```
ipython notebook
```
and then select the notebook that you want.
